Required Products

Econometrics Toolbox

Econometrics Toolbox no longer requires Financial Toolbox.

License Checkout

MATLAB Compiler

MATLAB Compiler will now check out licenses for toolboxes used in the code you compile. See MATLAB Answers for more information.

https://www.mathworks.com/products/new_products/r2016b-transition.html

No products have license-related changes in the R2016b release.

Renamed Products

Previous Name 	New Name

SimRF 	RF Blockset

Required Products

RF Blockset

RF Blockset (formerly SimRF) no longer requires Simscape.

https://www.mathworks.com/products/new_products/r2017b-transition.html

One product has a license-related change in R2017b. To use the latest version of this product, you must have a subscription to MathWorks Software Maintenance Service as of R2017b.

Simulink Verification and Validation

As of R2017b, Simulink Verification and Validation™ has transitioned into three products: Simulink Check™, Simulink Coverage™, and Requirements Toolbox™.

    Requirements traceability and Requirements Management Interface (RMI) functionality have moved to Requirements Toolbox.

    Model and generated code coverage functionality, and component verification functions such as slvnvmakeharness, have moved to Simulink Coverage.

    Compliance checking, model metrics, clone detection and refactoring, and model transformer functionality have moved to Simulink Check.

Simulink Check, Simulink Coverage, and Requirements Toolbox each require MATLAB® and Simulink®, but they do not have a dependency on each other. Simulink Design Verifier™, which required Simulink Verification and Validation, now requires both Simulink Check and Simulink Coverage.

Requirements Toolbox and Simulink Coverage are available starting release R2017b and later. Due to the transition of the Simulink Verification and Validation product, if you are using RMI (Requirements Management Interface) for requirements traceability or model / generated code coverage capabilities with R2017a or earlier then Simulink Check is required to use these capabilities. Simulink Check retains the license feature from Simulink Verification and Validation and allows for usage on older releases.
